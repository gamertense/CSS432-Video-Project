1
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,500
Hey, how's it going? Dave2D here

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,100
And this is the Acer Nitro 5. Now, this is a laptop

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,300
That's geared towards that whole inexpensive gaming market. It's 900 bucks.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,909
It's got a GTX 1050 Ti, 256 gigs of SSD and a Kaby Lake chip in here. I mean,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,500
There's a lot of stuff that I like about this thing, but if you'll notice the title of this video,

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,140
I don't

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,800
openly recommend this thing to everybody and the reason why is

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,500
because I feel like there's a better option than this for people who are

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,439
actually interested in this and it's not because this is a bad laptop,

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,309
This is actually a very good laptop

11
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,200
But as you'll see, there's something a little bit better than this

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,300
So the things that I do like about it. First,

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,000
I really like the build quality. This thing looks less gamer,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,039
I should say? Than the average cheap gaming laptop, so it has a red strip down here

15
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,048
But it's not that bright cherry red, it's more like a muted metallic burgundy color. It's still red

16
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:53,829
It's not my favorite thing

17
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:56,349
but I think it's a lot better than a lot of gaming laptops and

18
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,200
Everything else on the top at least is black, even that logo, the Acer logo is just simple black

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,360
and the components they've chosen in here are good. The 1050 Ti

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,400
Is that sweet spot for inexpensive 1080p gaming

21
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,300
The port selection is pretty standard for this price. You're getting three USB-A's and one USB-C,

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,270
not Thunderbolt 3 though

23
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:20,229
I like the screen, it's not amazing. It's an IPS screen, and it looks not bad. I mean it's a $900 gaming laptop

24
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:23,769
You're not gonna get 4K color accurate screens at this price, so yeah

25
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,500
I'm happy with the screen. The keyboard and the trackpad are also both good.

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,979
The keyboard is comfortable to use, nice layout. The one thing

27
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:34,059
That's a little bit weird on the layout is that the Shift and the Up arrow are really close together now

28
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,859
I personally didn't have any issues using it

29
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:37,859
but I think it'll depend on how your

30
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,589
Keyboard habits are if you- I don't know, if you hit your shift in a particular way

31
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,070
You might hit the Up arrow at the same time

32
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,800
But I don't have any issues

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,600
Trackpad is also really good, Windows Precision drivers

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,500
Acer has totally gone into the whole Windows Precision driver thing

35
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,179
They don't use anymore Elan or Synaptics drivers from what I've seen recently, so that's really nice

36
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,039
The speakers are located on the bottom, and they don't sound terrible or anything, they don't sound great

37
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,000
But it's a $900 gaming laptop. They kind of sound as you would expect

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,300
The build quality in the Nitro 5 is good

39
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,000
It's got a metal top panel, but everything else is plastic including the bottom panel,

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,879
but all the plastic parts feel good

41
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,309
There's access to the 2.5 inch SATA drive and the RAM slots through some hatches

42
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,789
But if you want to go deeper, you can remove the whole panel. The batteries down here

43
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,840
It's a 48 watt hour battery, and I'm getting a little bit less than four hours of battery life

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,140
And that's with the screen at 250 nits. It's so depending what you do

45
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,500
You'll be around there. Now so far everything sounds good, right?

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Everything seems proper on this laptop

47
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,000
But this is my one issue with this thing. The thermal design is...

48
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,829
Not ideal, so if you look over here

49
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:44,809
You can see the CPU and the GPU and there's two heat pipes that pull heat away from these chips

50
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,790
Which are cooled with these two fans

51
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,300
And I don't like seeing game laptops designed like this

52
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,600
So on a regular laptop that doesn't have a ton of thermal output

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,279
This is fine because I mean, it's a very effective and space efficient way of cooling things down

54
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,099
but on a gaming laptop with the GTX 1050 Ti

55
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,239
This is not ideal

56
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,909
And what ends up happening is that the heat from the CPU

57
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,979
Has to travel along this pipe pass the GPU before we get cooled by the two fans

58
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,800
And if you use your laptop for a really long time, the CPU builds up heat. Now the VX 15 is another

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,819
inexpensive laptop from Acer and that thing has a much better thermal design to me

60
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:22,300
There's still two heat pipes and two fans

61
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,700
But because the two fans are located on opposite ends,

62
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,900
each fan is gonna pull heat more readily from the closer chip

63
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,660
And you just get better thermal performance

64
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,000
Now if all you're doing is just browsing the web or just doing light stuff or

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
even playing games for just really short bursts for like

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,849
15-20 minutes, then you literally will never notice it. You will not see any kind of thermal issues

67
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,489
But if you play games for a long time like over an hour

68
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,000
You'll notice that the CPU temperature starts to creep up and up and

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
eventually you'll hit that wall. The one thermal advantage that I would

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,100
say the Nitro 5 has is that it does have "CoolBoost" technology

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,000
which is basically built-in software to allow you to control the fans.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,500
Now, the VX 15 does not have that and this does

73
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,059
and it can be helpful. The thing is you can always get like third-party software to control the fans

74
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,009
But this has it straight from the factory. So the fan on is on this thing at idle is not very loud

75
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,000
It's actually quite quiet, on load

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,500
it's a little bit louder, audible, but not too bad, but with CoolBoost on, this thing is quite loud

77
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,000
And it's still not good enough to maintain really high clock speeds for

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
extended periods of time despite it being super loud

79
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,240
So here's the thing, for $900, the market is very competitive right now

80
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,600
There's a lot of good options to choose from, the VX 15 the

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,929
Dell 7567, the upcoming 7577. This thing, the Nitro 5, they're all like kind of in that market

82
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,800
So if you're going to make a laptop that competes with this stuff,

83
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,590
if you're gonna spend the time and the resources

84
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,200
Like Acer did, to make the Nitro 5 a brand new laptop

85
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,000
Why like, why not make it something just more different?

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,800
There's nothing about this thing that makes it a compelling purchase

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,299
Okay, I take that back. There's two things that are unique about this, that don't matter to me

88
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,660
But I, to be fair I need to just kind of put this out there for full disclosure

89
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,200
This thing has a design like a visual design

90
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
That's better than the other laptops that it competes with

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The red isn't super obnoxious and the rest of it is pretty simple

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,570
The screen is also ever so slightly better than the VX 15 and the Dell 7567 screen

93
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,400
They're all IPS, but this one's just a little bit brighter, a little bit more color accurate

94
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,190
We're talking like 2 or 3%, so if those things are important to you

95
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,800
And you don't mind the thermal issues, sure, go for this thing,

96
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,500
but for most people, I wouldn't recommend this. The Acer VX 15 is just better all-around.

97
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,800
Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video!

98
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,710
Thumbs if you liked it, subs if you loved it.

99
00:05:35,710 --> 00:00:00,000
See you guys next time!
