1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,376
Hey how's it going to do to here

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,912
And this is the Acer Nitro

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,728
This is a laptop is geared towards that hoe Linux

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,008
Gaming Market

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
It's nine hundred bucks

6
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,056
It's got

7
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,080
A GTX 1050

8
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,616
TI 256

9
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
Pics of SSD

10
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
And a KB Lake

11
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:18,944
Japan

12
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,224
There's a lot of stuff that

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,296
I like about this thing but if you notice the title of this video

14
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:28,672
I don't openly recommend this thing to everybody and the reason why is because I feel like there's a better option than this

15
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952
For people who are actually

16
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,256
And it's not because this is a bad laptop

17
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,048
This is actually a very good laptop

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
But I will see

19
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,864
There's something little bit better than

20
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,656
So the things that I do like it

21
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
First I really like the bills

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,728
This thing looks

23
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,800
Les gamer I should say then the average

24
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,080
Cheap gaming laptop

25
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,896
It has a red stripe down here but it's not that bright

26
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,688
Cherry red is Marla commuted

27
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,224
Metallic burgundy color

28
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,064
It's still red on my favorite thing but I think it's a lot better than a lot of gaming laptop

29
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:00,416
And everything else on the top at least is black even that logo the Acer logo is a

30
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
Simple black

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,792
And the components are chosen in here are good the 1050ti is that sweet spot for

32
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
Inexpensive 1080p

33
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,400
The port selection is pretty standard for this price you getting 3 used

34
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
CPAs in one USB

35
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,960
PC not done about 3

36
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,544
I like the screen it's amazing it's an IPS screen

37
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
And it looks

38
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,848
Not bad I mean it's

39
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,896
$900 gaming laptop you're not going to get

40
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
4K

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
Color accurate screens at this price

42
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,224
So yeah I'm happy with

43
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,296
The screen the keyboard and the trackpad are also both good

44
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
The keyboard is helpful to use nice layout

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
The one thing that's a little bit weird on the layer is it the shift

46
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304
The up Arrow are really close together and I person didn't have any issues using it but I think it will depend on how your keyboard

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
Habits are

48
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
If you

49
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Get your shift

50
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,168
In a particular way you might hit the other at the same time

51
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
But I'm having issues

52
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,592
Trackers also really good Windows Precision drivers Acer has totally gone into the whole Windows Precision driver thing

53
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
They don't use anymore alandur snapped

54
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
The drivers from what I've seen recently

55
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
So that's really nice

56
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,552
The speakers are located on the bottom and they don't sound terrible or anything they don't sound

57
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
Great but it's $900 gaming laptop

58
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
The kind of sound as you

59
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,464
The bills pulling in the Nitro 5 is good

60
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
Got a metal top panel but everything else is

61
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
Does plastic include in the bottom panel

62
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
But all the plastic parts

63
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Feel good

64
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,400
Does access to the two and a half inch saddle Drive

65
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
And the ram slots

66
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,496
Patches but you want to go deeper you can remove the whole panel

67
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,592
The battery's down here it's a 48 watt hour battery and I'm getting a little bit less

68
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Stand for hours about

69
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
Vanessa screen at 200

70
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
Depending what you do

71
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
I'll be around

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
And so far everything sounds good right everything

73
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
Seems

74
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Proper on this laptop

75
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,648
But this is my one issue with this

76
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
The thermal design

77
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Is

78
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
Not ideal

79
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,048
Here you can see the CPU and the GPU

80
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,864
To keep pipes that pull heat away from these chips

81
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
Which it cooled with

82
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,960
And I don't like seeing game laptops

83
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
Designed like this

84
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
So on a regular laptop that doesn't have

85
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
Ton of thermal output

86
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
This is fine

87
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
Because when it's very effective

88
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
And space efficient way of

89
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Cooling things down

90
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
Put on a gaming laptop with a GTX 1050 TI

91
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,552
This is not ideal and what ends up happening

92
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Is that the Heat

93
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Receive you

94
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
How to travel along this pipe

95
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
Pasta GPU

96
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Fornia cooled by the

97
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,256
Hi to fans and if you use your laptop for a really long time

98
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
The CPU build up heat

99
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,864
X15 is another inexpensive laptops

100
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
Nothing has a much better thermal design tool

101
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
They're still to keep pipes

102
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
And two fans

103
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,312
But because the two fans are located on opposite end

104
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
Each fan is going to pull

105
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
Keep more readily from the closer

106
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Can you just get better thermal

107
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
Now if all you're doing

108
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
Is browsing the web or just doing light stuff

109
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
Are you done playing games for

110
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,600
Really short verse for like 15-20 minutes

111
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,928
Then you literally will never notice it you will not see any kind of thermal issues

112
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
But you play games for a long time

113
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
Over an hour

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
You'll notice that the CPU temperature starts

115
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
The creep up and up

116
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
And eventually you'll hit that way

117
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
The one thermal Advantage little to the Natural 5 has

118
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
If it does have cool boost

119
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
Technology which is basically built-in software

120
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
To allow you to

121
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Control the fan

122
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,616
The vx15 does not have that

123
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
This does

124
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
And it can be helpful

125
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
The thing is you can always get

126
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
Like third-party software to control the fans but this has it straight from the factory

127
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
So the fan was on this thing

128
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
A title is not very loud it's actually

129
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
Quite quiet unload it's a little bit louder audible but not too bad

130
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,536
But with cool boost on this thing is quite loud

131
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,607
And it's still not good enough to maintain really high clock speeds

132
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,655
For extended periods of time despite it being

133
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Super loud

134
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
So here's the thing

135
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
For $900

136
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
The market is

137
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Very competitive rate

138
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,847
Now there's a lot of good options to choose from the vx15

139
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
The Delsym

140
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
I67 2

141
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
Upcoming 7577

142
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
This thing the Nitro

143
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
Survive there always

144
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Kind of in that market

145
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,551
So if you're going to make a laptop

146
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
That competes

147
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
If you going to spend the time and the resources

148
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Like a sir did

149
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
To make the nitrifying

150
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Brand new laptop

151
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,791
Why like why not make it something just more different

152
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,607
That there's nothing about this thing that makes it a compelling purchase

153
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,703
Okay I take that back there's two things that are unique about

154
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,287
That don't matter to me but I'd to be fair I need to just kind of

155
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
Put this out there for full disclosure

156
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,943
This thing has a design like a visual design that's better than the other laptops

157
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Competes with

158
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
The red isn't super obnoxious

159
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
And the rest of it is pretty simple

160
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:15,903
The screen is also ever so slightly better than the vx15 and the Dell sometimes

161
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
Nexus 7 screen they're all IPS but this one

162
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Little brighter

163
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Little bit more Color actor

164
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Talking like

165
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
To 3%

166
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
So

167
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,631
If those are important to you and you don't want thermal issues

168
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
Sure go for this

169
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,703
But for most people I wouldn't recommend this

170
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
The Acer VX 15

171
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Is just

172
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Better already

173
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:38,687
Okay hope you guys enjoy this video thumbs we liked it sounds we loved it see you guys next time
