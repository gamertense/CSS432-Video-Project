1
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,168
Hey how's it going do you to be here

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,264
So this is Lenovo Legion y520 their mid-tier gaming laptop

3
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,312
And aesthetically I really like this

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,616
It feels nice to hold in your hand

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,408
And fingerprints don't show up too much

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,968
There's a full carbon fiber top and it's

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,760
Black everywhere even the logos

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:25,856
Most gaming laptops have some kind of red accents on the exterior

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
This doesn't

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
He pulled into lecture hall or even at work

11
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,952
No one would really notice

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,000
I also like the bronze or

13
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,840
Copper colored heatsink they can see through the back it's a pretty muted Bible to this laptop

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,888
Until you open it and you realize

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,912
There's red everywhere

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:42,752
Had to be fair about like the low-to-mid tear gaming laptops

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,824
This has not that much but it's there

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,664
The build quality is good it's on par with competitors in this price range

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,712
There isn't anything that feels poorly built

20
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,504
The chassis the screen

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,368
The hinges good to way better than the hinge on the older y50 or y700

22
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:03,232
The display is one of the better looking ones in the sub $1,000 gaming laptop

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,120
Teddy P color gamut is kind of mediocre in even after calibration color accuracy

24
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,168
The best but it's reasonably bright

25
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
And viewing angles are good cuz it's

26
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
IPS panel bezels aren't too thick

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
And the webcam look

28
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,152
The speakers are positioned nicely just below the screen

29
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
When you're playing games

30
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
It sounds like a projector

31
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
Right into your ears

32
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,552
The thing is these lack base there's

33
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,392
Decent volume but the lower frequencies just aren't there even when I'm playing around with you

34
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,464
Down at the keyboard we have a couple of different

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
Textures we haven't brushed finished up here

36
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
And then the rest of the deck

37
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
Is this kind of

38
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Soft touch

39
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,168
The keyboard has red accents and red backlighting

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,008
The number pad on the right is a little different

41
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
Sephora

42
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
If your number pad Pro we just use number

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Has often

44
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
You'll probably find

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920
The rest of the Lord is good

46
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Easy to type on

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
Keys have 120mm of travel

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,112
Keystrokes feel a little soft but comfortable to use I think most people will easily get you

49
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,720
The track put itself kind of feels like glass but I'm pretty sure it's plastic

50
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
It's just a nice smooth finish

51
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,328
Synaptics drivers but good tracking in Chester

52
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,144
Control the buttons are not.

53
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
Dedicated buttons

54
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,704
But they feel

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
Mediocre

56
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Like the middle area X

57
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
Like a lever so the closer It Gets In The Middle

58
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,408
The harder it is to click you can only press it down on the sides and I just don't love this

59
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
The port selection is good

60
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
Does Ethernet use

61
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
YouTube and audio jack

62
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
And I never said we have HDMI

63
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
A pair of USB 3

64
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
An SD reader

65
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
SPC

66
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,464
There's no sign of a 3 support but that's just the norm at this time

67
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
To get inside you flip it over remove some

68
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,608
Screws and open it up we have a good amount of upgrade welcome

69
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
Does a two and a half inch Drive Bay

70
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
An empty slot that supports

71
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,544
Pcie the configurations with SSD drives have pretty good speeds

72
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,128
And he pop up this metal Shredder here you can access the ramp

73
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,944
The battery's down here it's relatively small we're looking at

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
45 watt hour battery

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,552
I'm getting a little less than 4 hours of regular used with the

76
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
The screen at 200

77
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
50 minutes

78
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
If you're playing games is going to close in 45 minutes

79
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,160
To an hour

80
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,976
I really wish they'd put a bigger battery in this thing but

81
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
That's a compromise you going to make it

82
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
Performance overall is good

83
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
It uses Katy Lake CPUs

84
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
And a GTX 1050 TI even on the base

85
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,240
This model I'm running the upgraded i7 configuration

86
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
But the game performs are going to be really similar but

87
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
This

88
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
And I-5

89
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Does a more detailed video link in the description

90
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
But on the 1050ti

91
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
Can the 7700

92
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,504
HQ something lighter like OverWatch

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,552
70 frames per second on Ultra

94
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
On Highway looking at almost

95
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
On June 21st

96
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,440
Doom on Ultra will still float above six

97
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Second

98
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,280
Basically any of them or off to my Shooters will play really nice

99
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Beyond the system

100
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
Something a bit more demanding like

101
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
Battlefield 1 you need to drop the graphic

102
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,936
Hi to get into that 60 France

103
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,520
In general any of the current titles will play nicely on

104
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,592
Yeah it's the best value GPU for

105
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
If you're editing videos

106
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,944
This is still a great choice especially cuz

107
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,784
Two drives in there but if you didn't call or accurate work I would totally plug up a neck

108
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
External monitor

109
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,880
There is some thermal throttling if you posted by some benchmarks for

110
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,928
Long enough but I never know sudden any games

111
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
Even after hours of playing so should be good

112
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
Surface temperature even unload stays comfortable to use

113
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
There's also

114
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,679
Dream cooling mode and software to crank the fans up if you really want the best

115
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,751
Turbo performance the heat pipe layout isn't

116
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,335
My favorite is an older style design like the heat from the GPU has a

117
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
Pass through the sea

118
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
View along the pipe

119
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,711
The fans Austin spin on idle but

120
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:42,111
It's so quiet unload it can get a little louder. Too bad I didn't hit that fixstream fan mode I don't know when you actually use

121
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671
Use this but if you do it gets very noisy

122
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,999
Okay so the Lenovo Legend y520

123
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
You're getting a device with

124
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
A lot of plastic materials but with good build quality

125
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Decent IPS screen

126
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
Breitbart

127
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Weak color game

128
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Keyboard is good

129
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Trackpad is good

130
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,287
Buns on the trackpad are not

131
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
So good

132
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Inside

133
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
Dkb Lake CPU options

134
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
And the 1050

135
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
TTI deliver awesome performance

136
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
The dollar

137
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
Cooling is done reasonably well

138
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
The RAM and the storage are all easy to access for a few

139
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Future upgrades

140
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,159
The battery is a little late we're looking around for hours of average

141
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
So this laptop

142
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
There's not much I just like about it it's

143
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
For this price point it's

144
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Really good

145
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
The one advantage that I would say that Lenovo has

146
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
Over other competitors in this price point

147
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
Is that they often have

148
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Pretty Goods

149
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,263
Tell the right now you can get us in for $850

150
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
That's what the 10:50

151
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
ATI that's

152
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
Really good my opinion

153
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,151
Trying to decide between this laptop and

154
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,967
The three or four other laptops that are in this price range

155
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
I will be doing a comparative review

156
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
I want to do it sooner than later but

157
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
There's a fourth

158
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
Laptop that came to mix

159
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,231
Two-player for entered the game I will be doing that video shortly and then I'll be doing

160
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Comparative video

161
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
For all of them

162
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
Hope you guys enjoy this video sounds if you liked it

163
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
Subzi loved it
