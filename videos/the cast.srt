1
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:05,138
Do or do not.
There is no try.

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,640
Do or do not.
There is no try.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,109
All right, 
I'll give it a try.

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:09,643
No!

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,712
Try not.

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:16,416
Do or do not.
There is no try.

7
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,919
It's nice because
it could be a load of things.

8
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,454
Because I don't think 
doing the thing,

9
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:21,788
is the doing the thing.

10
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,691
It's just, if you try,
you're doing it anyway.

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,626
That's what I take from it.

12
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,596
I actually have three new
of my favorite Star Wars quotes.

13
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,198
-Oh, from this one?
-And they're all from this one.

14
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,133
They're incredible.

15
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,436
I'll go with,
"Never tell me the odds."

16
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,437
Oh, that's nice.

17
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:38,505
What are you doing?

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,209
You're not actually
going into an asteroid field?

19
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,844
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

20
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,149
You don't have to do this
to impress me.

21
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,219
Sir, the possibility
of successfully navigating an asteroid field

22
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,354
is approximately
3,720 to 1.

23
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,622
Never tell me the odds.

24
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,759
I love everything that Yoda says

25
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,430
and I love Frank Oz's performance
in that movie.

26
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,799
When he says,
"Luminous beings are we--"

27
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,738
Its energy surrounds us,
and binds us.

28
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,208
Luminous beings are we, 
not this crude matter.

29
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:19,613
Just the hint of kind of like
the bigger spiritual world of that

30
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:25,652
existing in this kind of pop, 
you know, soap opera, space opera,

31
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,321
that, I don't know.

32
00:01:27,321 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the first thing
that popped in my head.
